# Pneumonia-Detection
Collaborated with a group of students to create a CNN model that can accurately(90%+) detect Pneumonia when given patient data.
We used Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow's Keras to create numerous models, finding the best one for our dataset. 
We trained the model with our training dataset and predicted outcomes using our test dataset. After optimizing the model, we incorporated field data (real pulmonary x-rays from patients).
